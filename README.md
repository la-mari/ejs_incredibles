# The Incredibles - GA: Outcomes App
<https://ejsincredibles.herokuapp.com/>

Group Repo: <https://github.com/la-mari/ejs_incredibles>

**Description:**
<br>
This app was created in a team with the goal of supporting the Outcomes Team at General Assembly in helping recent WDI graduates find a job. It allows users to sign up and make an account so that they can share interview questions that they've received; post advice, comments, tutorials, etc; chat and whiteboard in real-time with eachother, practice coding with the text editor, and view employer ratings from Glassdoor.
 
**Installation Instructions:**
<br>
Fork the link and then clone it to your git repo in the terminal.  For help on that, clikc [here] ( )

Once you have it on your system, go into the "ejs_incredibles" folder and run:
> npm install

This will populate the app with all of the dependencies needed

From there you need to open a new tab in your Terminal - "Command + N"

In this tab, you want to run the following:

>mongod

If that doesn't work, try:

>sudo mongod

When it asks for your password, enter your login password for your computer.

Once your database and app are running, click this [link] (http:localhost:3000)

There is the app.

Alternatively, you can click the link under the links tab to go to it imediately, with no downloads.

####Our Approach:
Fortunately we were given topics to choose from, and as a group we narrowed down our top 3 very quickly.  We were all decided on our first pick, and were lucky enough to get it!

Once we had our project, we set up the neccessary interviews, and did 2 members per interview.  We changed up the paring for this, so that we each got to work separately with eachother.  We se aside 2 hours a day where we would work and code together, and then had our stand up meeting where we touched base too.

We divided the workload up by features, with each of us creating a branch for the feature we were working on.  Our Master of the Github - George - would handle all of the merges and conflicts, etc.

We had a very harmonious and synergistic group.  We collaborated and dove-tailed very well.
